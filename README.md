FlipPad
=======
by Marcus Ortiz

Why?
----
I made this simple little app, because I can never remember which floor of the parking garage I left my car on, and I wanted some more experience with writing android apps. 

Future Features
---------------
  - a "flipping" animation
  - some sort of touch feedback
  - a menu for different symbol sets
